This is not a perfect model by any means, there are many ways to improve it.

The saved model can be obtained here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZW4asfgnm34gCsV4qH-tIodwnvi0EABt/view?usp=share_link

1. Using opencv and it's face detection models freely would increase the accuracy.
2. Converting the image taken to a black and white image would reduce the parameters considered, and thus speed up the execution.
3. The camera frame can be adjusted on a jupyter notebook using opencv, on colab it's more difficult to do the same.
4. Timers to take photos can also be added to take photos quite simply in Jupyter notebook, using opencv, again, more difficult in colab.
